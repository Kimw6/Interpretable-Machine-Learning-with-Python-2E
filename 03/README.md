# CHAPTER 3
**_Interpretation Challenges_**

## How to Run

Open "FlightDelays.ipynb" notebook in a local Jupyter environment or open notebook in [Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UBdR2HhyvXXV0vTIMASSPBEkiuSk32E7/view?usp=sharing) (Best run on CPU with High RAM)

When you run it locally to install the requirements, you can run `chapter_setup.py` from the terminal like this:

But you can also do it from the first cell of the notebook.
