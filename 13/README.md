# CHAPTER 13
**_Adversarial Robustness_**

## How to Run

Open "Recidivism_part2.ipynb" notebook in a local Jupyter environment or open notebook in [Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VsBxTCK-8z6qqaZsohkMGt2i37wfqvbx/view?usp=sharing)

When you run it locally to install the requirements, you can run `chapter_setup.py` from the terminal like this:

python chapter_setup.py

But you can also do it from the first cell of the notebook.
