# CHAPTER 1
**_Interpretation, Interpretability, and Explainability; and why does it all matter?_**

## How to Run

Open "WeightPrediction.ipynb" notebook in a local Jupyter environment or open notebook in [Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12W2NkwK0YEWhu0ZCE-WJ7ruJQbLpcAHP/view?usp=sharing)

When you run it locally to install the requirements, you can run `chapter_setup.py` from the terminal like this:

``` sh
