# CHAPTER 2
**_Key Concepts of Interpretability_**

## How to Run

Open "CVD.ipynb" notebook in a local Jupyter environment or open notebook in [Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17XtIBNrvvbQSKA9jAIbSzcwaRQn8XtmK/view?usp=sharing)

When you run it locally to install the requirements, you can run `chapter_setup.py` from the terminal like this:

``` sh
python chapter_setup.py
