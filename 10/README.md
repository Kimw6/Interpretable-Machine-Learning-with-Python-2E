# CHAPTER 10
**_Feature Selection and Engineering for Interpretability_**

## How to Run

Open "Mailer.ipynb" notebook in a local Jupyter environment or open notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aoVToakCwNrACvjp_B0XwViE6fbv8Okz?usp=sharing) (Best run on CPU with High RAM)

When you run it locally to install the requirements, you can run `chapter_setup.py` from the terminal like this:

``` sh
python chapter_setup.py
```

But you can also do it from the first cell of the notebook.
