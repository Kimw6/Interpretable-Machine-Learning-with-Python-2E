# CHAPTER 9
**_Interpretation Methods for Multivariate Forecasting and Sensitivity Analysis_**

## How to Run

Open "Traffic_compact1.ipynb" notebook in a local Jupyter environment or open notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WOrNkAqglWRzQIaeqo1Cnu1HHYnEiJsx?usp=sharing)

When you run it locally to install the requirements, you can run `chapter_setup.py` from the terminal like this:
