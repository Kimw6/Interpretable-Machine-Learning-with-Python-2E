# CHAPTER 5
**_Local Model-agnostic Interpretation Methods_**

## How to Run

Open "ChocoRatings.ipynb" notebook in a local Jupyter environment or open notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vvvyYiuzYp0uGQIhfMqf-0V15gKfnSoZ?usp=sharing)

When you run it locally to install the requirements, you can run `chapter_setup.py` from the terminal like this:
